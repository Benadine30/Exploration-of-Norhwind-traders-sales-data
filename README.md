# Exploration-of-Northwind-traders-sales-data
This is Sales &amp; order data, including information on customers, products, orders, shippers, and employees for Northwind Traders, a global food supply company that specializes in supplying gourmet food products to restaurants, cafes, and food retailers around the world.  

As their data analyst, I have been tasked with building a top-level KPI dashboard with SQL queries for the stakeholders and Executive Team. This dashboard would give the company's Executives insights into the company's sales performance. Some of the insights include but are not limited to:

Sales Trends
Product Performance
Key Customers
Best Sales rep
Shipping Costs etc.

FEW RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE EXECUTIVES TO IMPROVE SALES: 
üìç Streamline order processing for faster delivery: It takes an average of 8 days for each order to be shipped, which is relatively slow. Improving the efficiency of the order processing system could enable faster deliveries, leading to increased customer satisfaction, loyalty, and good reviews.

üìç Increase focus on retaining high-value customers: Some customers have contributed significantly to their revenue. As such, it would be wise to increase efforts toward retaining these top customers and incentivizing them to continue doing business with the company.

üìç Focus more marketing efforts on USA and Germany: These two countries have been identified as their best-selling cities, implying a higher propensity for sales in those regions. It is recommended that the company allocate more marketing resources towards these areas to boost sales.

üìç lessen the use of Federal Shipping and United Package because of their freight costs and their longer delivery days.
